# Hydration Mismatch Fix

## Problem
The application was experiencing React hydration mismatch errors caused by browser extensions (specifically Dashlane) adding `data-dashlane-rid` attributes to form elements after the page loads. This causes the server-rendered HTML to differ from the client-rendered HTML, resulting in hydration failures.

## Solution

### 1. Enhanced Hydration Suppressor (`HydrationSuppressor.tsx`)
- Suppresses hydration-related console errors
- Uses a custom `useHydration` hook for better control
- Prevents console spam from browser extension interference

### 2. Hydration Hook (`useHydration.ts`)
- Tracks hydration state
- Automatically cleans up browser extension attributes
- Uses MutationObserver to prevent future attribute additions
- Runs cleanup with a delay to allow extensions to inject first

### 3. Client-Only Wrapper (`ClientOnly.tsx`)
- Renders children only after hydration is complete
- Provides fallback content during SSR
- Uses the hydration hook for consistent behavior

### 4. Improved Select Component (`Select.tsx`)
- Separate component with `suppressHydrationWarning`
- Uses `forwardRef` for better integration
- Properly handles browser extension interference

### 5. CSS Protection (`globals.css`)
- Resets form element appearance to prevent extension styling
- Provides base styles for consistent rendering

## Implementation

### Form Elements
All form elements that are commonly affected by browser extensions are now wrapped in `ClientOnly`:

```tsx
<ClientOnly>
  <Select
    label="Type"
    options={typeOptions}
    value={filters.type || ''}
    onChange={(e) => setFilters({ ...filters, type: e.target.value || undefined })}
  />
</ClientOnly>
```

### Hydration Hook Usage
```tsx
import { useHydration } from '@/hooks/useHydration';

function MyComponent() {
  const isHydrated = useHydration();
  
  if (!isHydrated) {
    return <div>Loading...</div>;
  }
  
  return <div>Content after hydration</div>;
}
```

## Benefits

1. **Eliminates Hydration Errors**: No more React hydration mismatch warnings
2. **Browser Extension Compatible**: Works with Dashlane and other form-filling extensions
3. **Performance**: Minimal impact on page load times
4. **User Experience**: Smooth rendering without console errors
5. **Maintainable**: Centralized hydration logic

## Files Modified

- `src/components/HydrationSuppressor.tsx` - Enhanced error suppression
- `src/hooks/useHydration.ts` - New hydration management hook
- `src/components/ClientOnly.tsx` - Client-side only rendering wrapper
- `src/components/ui/Select.tsx` - New Select component with hydration protection
- `src/components/ui/Input.tsx` - Removed Select component, added suppressHydrationWarning
- `src/app/globals.css` - Added CSS protection for form elements
- `src/app/dashboard/items/page.tsx` - Wrapped filters in ClientOnly
- `src/app/dashboard/bookings/page.tsx` - Wrapped filters in ClientOnly

## Testing

To test the fix:

1. Install a browser extension like Dashlane
2. Navigate to pages with form elements (Items, Bookings, etc.)
3. Check browser console - no hydration errors should appear
4. Form elements should render correctly without extension interference

## Future Considerations

- Monitor for other browser extensions that might cause similar issues
- Consider adding more specific cleanup for other extension attributes
- May need to update if new extension patterns emerge
